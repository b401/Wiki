# IA-32 Registers

## General puprose Registers

All registers are 32-bit in length (4bytes).  
Each of the 2 lower bytes in the *EAX,EBX,ECX and EDX* registers can be referenced by AX and then subdivided by the names *AH,BH,CH and DH* for high bytes and *AL,BL,CL and DL* for the low bytes which are 1 byte each.

In addition, the *ESI,EDI,EBP and ESP* can be referenced by their 16-bit equivalent which is *SI,DI,BP and SP*.


For example: 
```
EAX = 32 bit
AX = 16 bit
AH = upper 8 bit of AX
AL = lower 8 bit of AX

+-------------------------+--------------+---------------+
|                         |              |               |
|                         |              |               |
+-------------------------+--------------+---------------+
{                            EAX                         }
                          {              AX              }
                          {      AH      }{     AL       }  
```

###  EAX
*Mostly used for return values*
Main register used in arithmetic calculations. Also known as accumulator, as it holds results of arithmetic operations and function return values.
###  EBX
The base register. Pointer to data in the _DS_ segment. Used to store the base address of the program.

TODO Check which base address.. (Of main or the init address?)
####   ECX
The Counter register is often used to hold a value representing the number of times a process is to be repeated. Used for loop and string operations.
###  EDX
A general purpose register. Additionally used for I/O operations. In addition will extend EAX to 64-bits.
###  ESI
Source Index register. Pointer to data in the segment pointed to by the DS register. Used as an offset address in string and array operations. It holds the address from where to read data.
## # EDI
Destination index register. Pointer to data ( or destination ) in the segment pointed to by the ES register. Used as an offset address in string and array operations. It holds the implied write address of all string operations.
### EBP
Base Pointer. Pointer to data on the stack ( in the SS segment ). It points to the bottom of the current stack frame. It is used to reference local variables.
### ESP
Stack Pointer ( in the SS segment ). It points to the top of the current stack frame. It is used to reference local variables.

## Segment Registers
The segment registers are used specifically for referencing memory locations. There are three different methods of accessing system memory.

Each segment register is 16-bit and contains the pointer of the start of the memory-specific segment.

Segment registers are considered part of the OS and can neither read nor be changed directly in almost all cases.

### CS (Code segment)
Code segment register stores the base location of the code section *(.text section)* which is used for data access.

It contains the pointer to the code segment in memroy where the cpu instructions are stored.  The processor retrieves instruction codes from memory base on the CS registers values and an offset value contained in the EIP register. The CS register cannot be changed as the value gets assigned by the initial memory space.
### DS (Data segment)
Data segment register stores the default location for variables *(.data section)* which is used for data access.
### ES (Extra segment)
Extra segment register which is used during string operations.
### SS (Stack segment)
Stack segment register stores the base location of the stack segment and is used when implicitly using the stack pointer or when explicitly using the base pointer

### FS (Extra segment register)
n/a
### GS (Extra segment register)
n/a

## Control Registers

The data canÂ´t be directly accessed but moved to a general-purpose register.

### CR0
System flag that control the operating mode and various states of the processor.

### CR1
Currently not implemented

### CR2
Memory page fault information

### CR3
Memory page directory information

### CR4
Flags that enable processor feathers and indicate feature capabilities of the processor.

## Flags (EFLAGS)

There are three kinds of flags which are as following:

### Status Flag
#### CF (Carry Flag)
Is set when a math operation on an unsigned integer value generates a carry or borrow for the most significatn bit. This is an overflow condition for the register involved in the math operation. When this occurs, the remaining data in the register is not the correct answer to the math operation.

#### PF (Parity Flag)
Is used to indicate corrupt data as a result of a math operation in a register. When checked, the parity flag is set if the total number of 1 bits in the result is even and is clreaed if the total number of 1 bits in th result is odd. When the parity flag is checked, an application can determine whether the register has been corrupted since the operation.

#### AF (Adjust Flag)
The adjust flag is used in Binary Coded Decimal math operations and is set if a carry or borrow operation occurs from bit 3 of the register used for the calculation.

#### ZF (Zero Flag)
Is set if the result of an operation is zero.

#### SF (Sign Flag)
Is set to the most significant bit of the result which is the sign bit and indicates whether the result is positive or negative.

#### OF (Overflow Flag)
Is used in signed integer arithmetic when a positive value is too big or a negative value is too small to be represented in the register.

### Control Flags
Control Flags are utilized to control specific behavior in the processor.  
The DF flag which is the direction flag is used to control the way strings are handled by the processor. When set, string instructions automatically decrement memory addresses to get the next byte in the string. When cleared, string instructions automatically increment memory addresses to get the next byte in the string.

*System flags are used to control OS level operations which should NEVER be modified by any respective program or application*

#### TF (Trap Flag)
Is set to enable single-step mode and when in this mode the processor performs only one instruction code at a time, waiting for a signal to performs only one instruction code at a time, waiting for a signal to perform the next instruction.

#### IF (Interrupt Enable Flag)
The interrupt enable flag controls how the processor responds to signals received from external sources

#### IOPL (I/O Privilege Level Flag)
The I/O privilege field indicates the input-output privilege level of the currently running task and defines access levels for the input-output address space which must be less than or equal to the access level required to access the respective address space. In the case where it is not less than or equal to the acces level required, any request to access the address space will be denied.

#### NT (Nested Task Flag)
The nested task flag controls whether the currently running task is linked to the previously executed task and is used for chaining interrupted and called tasks.

#### VM (Virtual-8086 Mode Flag)
The VM flag indicates that the processor is operating in virtual-8086 mode instead of protected or real mode.

TODO: more info about this mode

#### AC (Alignment Check Flag)
Is used in conjunction with the AM bit in the CR0 control register to enable alignment checking of memory references.

#### VIF (Virtual Interrupt Flag)
The virtual interrupt flag replicates the IF flag when the procesor is operating in virtual mode.

#### VIP (Virtual Interrupt Pending Flag)
The virtual interrupt pending flag is used when the processor is operating in virtual mode to indicate that an interrupt is pending.

#### ID (Identification Flag)
The ID flag indicates whether the processor supports the CPUID instruction

TODO: Get more info about CPUID

### Physical Address Extension (PAE)

PAE is the mode in which most modern operating systems execute.

Provides the following features:
- Virtual Memory
- Paging
- Privilege levels
- Segmentation
